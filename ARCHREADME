Now that your packages are installed properly, you must create a 
PostgreSQL user, initialize the database, and run the command to start 
the server.

If this is the first time you've installed or run PostgreSQL, run the 
following commands to setup and initialize the database directory:

    # sudo mkdir /var/lib/postgres/data
    # sudo chown -c postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgres/data
    # sudo initdb -D ‘/var/lib/postgres/data’
    # sudo systemctl start postgresql
    # sudo systemctl enable postgresql


Assign your PostgreSQL an admin password:

    # sudo -u postgres psql postgres
    postgres=# \password postgres


Create a PostgreSQL user with which you can access the database. This 
will match the username you use to connect to your Tent server. It is 
recommended that this username match that of your Unix user.

    # sudo -u postgres createuser $username


Run the following to create the database and to set your database user's 
password. This will match the password you use to connect to your Tent 
server. If you chose a username other than that of your Unix user, add 
"sudo -u USERNAME" before the "psql" command.

    # createdb tent_server
    # psql tent_server
    tent_server=> ALTER ROLE $username ENCRYPTED PASSWORD ‘$password‘;
    tent_server=> \q


Finally, go to /var/lib/tentd-admin and initialize the database, then 
you're ready to run the server.

    # cd /var/lib/tentd-admin
    # DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/tent_server bundle exec rake db:migrate


The following command enables the server (all on one line):

# DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/tent_server ADMIN_USERNAME=username 
ADMIN_PASSWORD=password bundle exec puma -p 3000


Note that the server cannot be run in the background this way. For more 
information, or to see more important environment variables based on 
your situation, visit the README at https://github.com/tent/tentd-admin.
